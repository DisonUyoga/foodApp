### Example Code Snippets

#### Geolocation and Mapping using Expo and Google Maps API:
```javascript
import * as Location from 'expo-location';
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const PizzaDeliveryMap = () => {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      let { status } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        
        return;
      }

      let location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({});
      setLocation(location);
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <MapView
      style={{ flex: 1 }}
      region={{
        latitude: location?.coords.latitude || 37.78825,
        longitude: location?.coords.longitude || -122.4324,
        latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
        longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
      }}>
      {location && (
        <Marker
          coordinate={{ latitude: location.coords.latitude, longitude: location.coords.longitude }}
          title="Your Location"
        />
      )}
    </MapView>
  );
};

export default PizzaDeliveryMap;
```

#### Push Notifications with Expo:
```javascript
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const PizzaDeliveryNotifications = () => {
  const [expoPushToken, setExpoPushToken] = useState('');
  const [notification, setNotification] = useState(false);
  const notificationListener = useRef();
  const responseListener = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    registerForPushNotificationsAsync().then(token => setExpoPushToken(token));

    notificationListener.current = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
      setNotification(notification);
    });

    responseListener.current = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      
    });

    return () => {
      Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription(notificationListener.current);
      Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription(responseListener.current);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your component code
  );9/8

  
};

async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync() {
  let token;
  const { status: existingStatus } = await Permissions.getAsync(Permissions.NOTIFICATIONS);
  let finalStatus = existingStatus;

  if (existingStatus !== 'granted') {
    const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.NOTIFICATIONS);
    finalStatus = status;
  }

  if (finalStatus !== 'granted') {
    alert('Failed to get push token for push notification!');
    return;
  }

  token = (await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()).data;
  console.log(token);
  return token;
}

export default PizzaDeliveryNotifications;
```

These features and snippets will help you build a comprehensive pizza delivery app, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for both users and restaurant staff.
